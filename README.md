[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-100%25-green)](https://github.com/ColCross/bgg-sdk/tree/main/tests)

A modern SDK for interacting with the BoardGameGeek (BGG) XMLAPI2, written in TypeScript and inspired by [BGG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bgg).

## Core Features

- Support for all BGG XMLAPI2 endpoints (see [documentation](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2))
- Automatic conversion of responses from XML to JSON
- Exponential retry for queued requests
- Full type safety for requests and responses
- Support for both CommonJS and ES modules
- Usable in both server and browser environments

## Quickstart

```bash
    npm install bgg-sdk
```

## Code Example

```typescript
import BGG from "bgg-sdk";

// Create a new BGG instance with bearer token (required)
const bgg = new BGG({
  bearerToken: "your-bearer-token-here"
});

// Use the instance to make API calls
const results = await bgg.search({ query: "scythe" });

// results
{
  "attributes": {
    "termsofuse": "https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "398158",
      "type": "boardgame",
      "name": "Grind House: Scythes Out",
      "yearPublished": "2023"
    },
    {
      "id": "226320",
      "type": "boardgame",
      "name": "My Little Scythe",
      "yearPublished": "2017"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the axios instance by passing configuration options to the BGG constructor:

```typescript
import BGG from "bgg-sdk";

const bgg = new BGG({
  bearerToken: "your-bearer-token-here", // Required: Bearer token for authentication
  retries: 5, // Number of retry attempts (default: 3)
  retryDelay: (retryCount) => retryCount * 1000, // Custom retry delay function
  axiosConfig: {
    baseURL: "https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi2/", // Custom base URL
    timeout: 10000, // Request timeout in ms
    headers: {
      "User-Agent": "MyApp/1.0",
      // Note: Authorization header is automatically set with bearerToken
    },
    // Any other axios configuration options
  },
});

const results = await bgg.search({ query: "scythe" });
```

## Contributing

Hey there! 👋

I hope you've found my sdk useful for your project, but if you found any bugs please open an issue and I'll address it as soon as I can.

Of course always feel free to take a crack at fixing it yourself and opening a PR!

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repo** and clone it to your machine.
2. **Install dependencies** with `npm install`.
3. **Make your changes** in a new branch.
4. **Test your changes** to make sure everything works as expected.
   1. Run `npm test` and fix / add any necessary tests to maintain 100% code coverage. _Your PR cannot be merged until all tests pass._
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Future Plans

- Do proper type casting so not all return types are strings. (consequence of working with original xml data)
